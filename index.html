        <p>I have watched many anime, and I have four favorites: Skate: The Infinity, Fullmetal Alchemist, Black Clover, and Blue Exorcist.</p>
        <p>Why I like these anime: Skate: The Infinity tells the story of two friends, Reki and Langa. Langa was a snowboarder, but when his father died, he stopped snowboarding and moved to Japan, where he started skateboarding. Fullmetal Alchemist is another favorite. <a href="https://kotik-ashotik.github.io/anime/">Learn more about other anime</a></p>

        <h1>My Favorite Anime Characters</h1>
        <p>I have many favorite characters, and here are some of them: Asta, Akumura Rin, Edward Elric, and Alphonse Elric.</p>
        <p>Why I like these characters: Asta was a normal kid, but in a world of magic, he had no mana. However, his brother had a lot of mana and could control it. I don't have a lot of time, so I will only tell you about Asta. That's all, sayonara!</p>
